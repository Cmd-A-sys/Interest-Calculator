# Simple and Compound Interest Calculator

## Overview

This Python project calculates **Simple Interest (SI)** and **Compound Interest (CI)** based on user inputs. It is designed to provide a practical understanding of interest calculations while showcasing basic Python programming skills.

## Features

- **Simple Interest Calculation**  
  Formula:  
  \[
  SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
  \]  
  where:  
  - \( P \): Principal amount  
  - \( R \): Annual interest rate (%)  
  - \( T \): Time period (in years)  

- **Compound Interest Calculation**  
  Formula:  
  \[
  CI = P \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^T - P
  \]  
  where:  
  - \( P \): Principal amount  
  - \( R \): Annual interest rate (%)  
  - \( T \): Time period (in years)  

- User-friendly interface for entering data.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
